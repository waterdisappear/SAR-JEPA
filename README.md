# SAR-JEPA: A Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture for SAR ATR

I'll release codes and weight as soon as I'm done other projects, no later than April of this year.

These are codes and weights of the paper [Predicting Gradient is Better: Exploring Self-Supervised Learning for SAR ATR with a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15153):


### Pre-training


### Fine-tuning with pre-trained checkpoints
